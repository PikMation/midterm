            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my Portfolio website where you'll see all my work made in display from the past.

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>The skills that I have have been varied that I learned from my high school years and college years. The skills I learn is digital art, 2D arts animation, 3D modeling and animation, and game design. All the works that I made will be catergorized into three different paths, 2D, 3D, and Game. 2D is where my 2D design, animation and digital art will be seen. There are some arts that are missing from the past as it was removed from a software somehow and I didn't save the arts. If I found the arts from other means, I'll update it to included them. There is a demo reel included to demostrate the digital arts I created in it. 3D contains 3D models and animation that I created. There is, like in 2D section, a demo reel to showcase the 3 3D models I created as part of the portfolio. Lastly, the game is where all the game I made will be included. Not only will there be game made digitally, I also made a board game that was a work in progress however I had to make a choice for this game that you'll see in the Board game description however it is possible I'll change my mind. Any games that are in beta, demo, or a full game will be included or updated.</p>

            <h2>Company</h2>
            <p>The company that I'm planning to create is called the Pikmation. It is a placeholder name for the company name until I decided a different name or if I wanted to use it as a offcial name. What the company will become will be both animation production and game design, mostly game design, based on the 10 characters used in game and animation. In the plan link, it'll explain what my goals for this company, the game being planned or in development and annoucement.</p>
